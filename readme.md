# Downloadify

Downloadify is a simple web app that allows you to download songs from a public Spotify playlist in mp3 format. Simply input the playlist id and Downloadify will handle the rest!

## Features

- Download individual songs from a public Spotify playlist
- Convert songs to mp3 format

## Usage

## Tips

- The playlist id can be found in the Spotify playlist URL. For example, in the URL "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWZeKCadgRdKQ", the playlist id is "37i9dQZF1DWZeKCadgRdKQ".
- Make sure the playlist is public, otherwise it cannot be downloaded.
